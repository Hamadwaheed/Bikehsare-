## Bikeshare Data Analysis

#### This data consisted of over half a million entries regarding bikeshare user demographics, time, and location! The data set was provided by Lyft and was one of the larger sets of data they had. this one in particular was for the years 2017-2018 and provided key insights into biking patterns.

## Summary of Findings

#### The trends I noticed initially from the data was that the most common season for bikesharing was fall and winter. The peak of all the months was october. The bikesharers were further divided according to consumer demographics. Some were customers and some were subscribers. We didn't originally know how many each demographic consisted of but we came to find out that subscribers outnumbered the customers by a ratio of 4! additionally we set out to find the differences between these two demographics. judging by the univariate trends I came to the conclusion that these users had the same time and day routine and were just subscribers that didn't want to go through the hassle of being a subscriber. I later came to find out that customers on average were highly active on the weekends vs subscribers who were highly active on the weekday. Subscribers adhered to normal routine 9-5 commuting patterns, riding in the evening and morning times. while customers, who ride on weekends, had a more spread out patter and had less routine. 

## Key insights

#### The major points I wanted to reiterate to the audience was that the intial conclusion from the initial trend was wrong. I had believed there was little to no disparity in day and time variables when considering both user types. This was one of the most significant findings, in addition to the seasonal distribution. A typical rider from this bikesharing data is a subscriber who commutes to either school or work, and does this on weekdays, in the winter months.
